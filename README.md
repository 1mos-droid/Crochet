🧶 Crochet Shop
![App Screenshot](public/media/Screenshot_20251120_153302_AloHTML%20Editor.jpg)
A full-stack e-commerce web application designed for browsing and purchasing handcrafted crochet items. This project demonstrates a modern shopping experience using vanilla frontend technologies backed by a robust Express.js server.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend:
 * HTML5: Semantic structure and layout.
 * CSS3: Custom styling, animations, and responsive design.
 * JavaScript (ES6+): DOM manipulation, cart logic, and API fetching.
Backend:
 * Node.js: Runtime environment.
 * Express.js: RESTful API routing and static file serving.
✨ Features
 * Product Showcase: dynamic gallery of crochet items (amigurumi, clothing, accessories) fetched from the backend.
 * Shopping Cart: Add/remove items, adjust quantities, and view real-time total price calculations.
 * Responsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing.
 * RESTful API: Express backend handles product data requests and serves static assets.
